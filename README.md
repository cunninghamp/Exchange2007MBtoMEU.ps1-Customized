Exchange2007MBtoMEU.ps1-Customized
==================================

A customized version of Microsoft's Exchange2007MBtoMEU.ps1 for Office 365 migrations.

Usage instructions by Microsoft:
http://community.office365.com/en-us/w/exchange/845.convert-exchange-2007-mailboxes-to-mail-enabled-users-after-a-staged-exchange-migration.aspx

I have added logging output and some error handling to assist with running this script in production environments.

Original script is located at:

Microsoft's original readme and disclaimer info:

Attached is a Windows PowerShell (PS1) script that you can run in your on-premises Exchange 2007 organization to convert mailboxes to mail-enabled users (MEUs). You can convert mailboxes to MEUs after youâ€™ve migrated those mailboxes to Office 365 using a staged Exchange migration.

The attached file is actually a .txt file. After you download the file, change the filename suffix to .ps1

We've posted a wiki page with step-by-step instructions on how to use this script to convert Exchange 2007 mailboxes to MEUs after a staged Exchange migration.
